- Fix incorrect vertical alignment of vehicles on race state.
- In vehicle sprite specification, create separate x and y scales.
- Implement a simple, generic torque curve instead of current flat torque curve along RPM range.
- Load more data from vehicle properties file, including some informative data (gives a hipster feel).
- Use a comma-separated list of gear ratio to specify gear ratios on vehicle properties.
- Use a comma-separated list of gear ratio to specify frame count for each state on vehicle properties.
- Introduce dynamic horizontal and vertical tilt when making turns or passing slopes, for a better animation.
- Introduce dynamic zoom perturbations to give a fake sense of depth when accelerating or braking, for a better animation.
- Introduce a speed-independent RPM simulation, to make it possible to simulate tire slipping and slide.
- Create a smoke animation.
- Use a sprite background instead of a picture.
- Create props to decorate the road.
- Introduce a more human-readable course file format, or create a usable course editor.
