- Fix the game's physics calculations regarding torque/power. Currently, torque is incorrect most of the time.
- Make possible to input vehicle real-life width instead of sprite scale.
- Add aspect ratio to vehicle specification so it can be possible to specify it instead of individual x/y scale. 
- Add different terrains.
- Add traffic cars.
- Add opponent cars. 
- Create props to decorate the road.
- Introduce dynamic horizontal and vertical tilt when making turns or passing slopes, for a better animation.
- Introduce dynamic zoom perturbations to give a fake sense of depth when accelerating or braking, for a better animation.
- Introduce a speed-independent RPM simulation, to make it possible to simulate tire slipping and slide.
- Add noise for vehicle sliding on grass.
- Scale the bg to be resolution-independent.
- Create a new UI. 
- Fix incorrect tire animation speed.
- Introduce a more human-readable course file format, or create a usable course editor (inspirations: Stunts)
- Use a comma-separated list of gear ratio to specify gear ratios on vehicle properties.
- Use a comma-separated list of gear ratio to specify frame count for each state on vehicle properties.
