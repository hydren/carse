# to do

- Add switch to select simulation mode.
- Fix wrong torque curve generation, torque from 1000rpm is wrong.
- Needs predefined torque curve profiles. For real.
- Needs to account for downforce. At least soft-simulation, semi-empirical.
- Fix getting stuck on grass.
- Fix braking simulation when using pacejka scheme. Move it to wheel torque calculation.
- Optimize velocimeter drawing by caching geometric coordinates
- Add gear shifting sounds
- Add optional gear shifting sounds derived from forced induction
- Improve UI to choose vehicle skins.
- Create showroom background for vehicle selection mode
- Add option for vehicle to specify custom smoke
- Add option for vehicle to specify custom gear shifting sound
- Add transition effects to each state.
- Add different terrains.
- Add traffic cars.
- Add opponent cars. 
- Create more props to decorate the road.
- Introduce dynamic horizontal and vertical tilt when making turns or passing slopes, for a better animation.
- Introduce dynamic zoom perturbations to give a fake sense of depth when accelerating or braking, for a better animation.
- Add vehicle shaking animation (when off-roading or in rough terrain)
- Add digital display
- Add menu music
- Howl engine when selecting car (either a default engine howl or one using the car engine profile).
- Set resolution/fullscreen mode from options
- Introduce a more human-readable course file format, or create a usable course editor (inspirations: Stunts)
- Use a comma-separated list of gear ratio to specify gear ratios on vehicle properties.
- Use a comma-separated list of gear ratio to specify frame count for each state on vehicle properties.

# bugs

- Fix the ingame background to make it resolution-independent.
- Fix incorrect tire animation speed.
- Fix car names trespassing window size.
- Fix the game's physics calculations regarding torque/power. Currently, torque is incorrect most of the time.
- Fix power at lower RPMs, as RPM is being set as its minimum before power computation
- Fix gear shifting prediction. It should change when the next/previous gear provides more torque/power than the current one.
