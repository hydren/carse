# to do

- Add shift time
- Optimize velocimeter drawing by caching geometric coordinates
- Add gear shifting sounds
- Add optional gear shifting sounds derived from forced induction
- Improve UI to choose vehicle skins.
- Create showroom background for vehicle selection mode
- Add option for vehicle to specify custom smoke
- Add option for vehicle to specify custom gear shifting sound
- Add transition effects to each state.
- Add different terrains.
- Add traffic cars.
- Add opponent cars. 
- Create props to decorate the road.
- Introduce dynamic horizontal and vertical tilt when making turns or passing slopes, for a better animation.
- Introduce dynamic zoom perturbations to give a fake sense of depth when accelerating or braking, for a better animation.
- Introduce a speed-independent RPM simulation, to make it possible to simulate tire slipping and slide.
- Add noise for vehicle sliding on grass.
- Add vehicle shaking animation (when off-roading or in rough terrain)
- Add digital display
- Scale the bg to be resolution-independent.
- Add menu music
- Howl engine when selecting car (either a default engine howl or one using the car engine profile).
- Set resolution/fullscreen mode from options
- Finish Options menu (including making it properly accessible)
- Create a new UI.
- Introduce a more human-readable course file format, or create a usable course editor (inspirations: Stunts)
- Use a comma-separated list of gear ratio to specify gear ratios on vehicle properties.
- Use a comma-separated list of gear ratio to specify frame count for each state on vehicle properties.


# bugs

- Fix missing frame animation with assymetric sprites on its final state (F50 bug).
- Fix bg scaling on race.
- Fix incorrect tire animation speed.
- Fix car names trespassing window size.
- Fix the game's physics calculations regarding torque/power. Currently, torque is incorrect most of the time.
- Fix power at lower RPMs, as RPM is being set as its minimum before power computation
- Fix gear shifting. It should change when the next/previous gear provides more torque/power than the current one.
- Fix tire grip formula to account for terrain type (currently just the rolling resistance accounts for terrain)
