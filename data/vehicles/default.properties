# The vehicle's mass, in kg. (default=1250)

# Tire diameter, in mm.     (default=678; eq. to 26.7 inch, 275/40 R18 tire)

### engine

# The engine's max. rpm. Normal values are 5000-12000.    (default=7000)
engine_maximum_rpm = default

# The engine's maximum power, in hp.      (default=320)

### transmission

# The number of gears. Any positive integer can be used.    (default=6)
gear_count = default

# Gear ratios mode. Can be default or custom.

### sprite

# The image containing all the sprites (sprite sheet)      (default=built-in sprite)
sprite_sheet_file = default

# The number of animations/states (straight-going, turning, etc) on this sheet, arranged top-down.    (default=1)

# (Optional) a scaling factor applied to the sprite; 1.0 is no scaling.        (default=1.0)
# the recommended way to choose this value is to take the vehicle's actual width (in mm) 
# and divide by its width on the sprite (in pixels) and then multiply the result by 24/895.
sprite_scale = default

# (Optional) The offset between the sprite's bottom and the depicted contact point of the vehicle.       (default=<depends>)
# Usually the contact point(s) are the bottom of the vehicle's wheels, so this value can be fitted
# with ammount of pixels between the bottom of the sprite and bottom of the wheels. This is useful
# to specify when the sprite has a unusually large shadow, for example.
# When this value is specified as "default", a value of 2px is assumed. If left unspecified, the
# offset is assumed to be 0.
sprite_contact_offset = default

# (Optional) The filename of the image containing the sprite for the brakelights effect overlay.      (default=<built-in asset>)
# The image must contain either a single image or a sheet with a number of sprites matching the
# amount of states (each case should be reported in the 'brakelights_multiple_sprites' property).
# Note that the actual brakelight image portraited in the sheet should be in the same scale as
# the vehicle sprite sheet if the 'brakelights_multiple_sprites' property is set as true.
# If unspecified or set as default, a built-in asset will be used for the effect.
