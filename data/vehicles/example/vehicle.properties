# Specify a sound file with notation 'soundX', where X is a positive integer.
# Specify a RPM range for each sound with the '_rpm' suffix ('soundX_rpm'). Besides a RPM value, it can also be set as -1 (unspecified) or 'redline' (redline zone sound). 
# If left unspecified, it is attempted to set default values, but usually they end up being unsuitable.
# You should specify as 'redline' a sound sample taken from an engine at its redline range. this sample sound won't be pitched or faded in/out. Only ONE range can be specified as 'redline'.

# the approximate angle (in degrees) depicted on the last sprite (most turned).        (default=60)
# the actual angle depicted on sprites varies a lot and even their most turned position may be small, causing a weird "feeling" in-game that the car is understeering.
# so specifying a value less than 45 causes the sprite to "develop" faster (turn faster), althought there is no change on the actual physics of the game.
# values greater than 45 makes some sprites not show on screen since the maximum angle in-game is supposed to be 45 degreeds (pi/4 radians)
# specifying this value is optional and if you are unsure, set as default or leave unspecified.
