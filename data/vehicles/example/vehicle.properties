# (Optional) Alternative sprite sheets that can be selected ingame. Each entry should have its own index.
# The syntax is 'alternate_sprite_sheet<i>_file', where <i> is the alternative sprite index.
# Another syntax can be used, as well, to specify an external properties file to load sprite-related 
# settings for the alternative sprite. The syntax would be 'alternate_sprite_sheet<i>_definition_file'.
# Otherwise all the sprite metrics specified in this file also applies to all alternative sprites.
# Be careful to not mix up indexes (they start at 0).

# (Optional) The vehicle's width (in pixels) as depicted on the sprite.                               (default=85.7% of frame width)

# Although optional, it is recommended to specify this, otherwise the vehicle can appear too big or 
# too small compared to the others. The recommended way to obtain a suitable value for scale is to 
# divide the vehicle's real life width (in mm) by its width on the sprite (in pixels) and 
# then multiply the result by 24/895.

sprite_keep_aspect_ratio = false

# (Optional) The offset between the sprite's bottom and the depicted contact point of the vehicle.       (default=0)
# Usually the contact point(s) are the bottom of the vehicle's wheels, so this value can be fitted
# with ammount of pixels between the bottom of the sprite and bottom of the wheels. This is useful
# to specify when the sprite has a unusually large shadow, for example.
sprite_contact_offset = 2

# (Optional) The approximate angle (in degrees) depicted on the last sprite (most turned).               (default=60)
# The actual angle depicted on sprites varies a lot and even their most turned position may be small, 
# causing a weird "feeling" in-game that the car is understeering. So specifying a value less than 45
# causes the sprite to "develop" faster (turn faster), althought there is no change on the actual 
# physics of the game. Values greater than 45 makes some sprites not show on screen since the maximum
# angle in-game is supposed to be 45 degreeds (pi/4 radians). Specifying this value is optional and 
# if you are unsure, set as default or leave unspecified.

# (Optional) The number of frames of each animation state.                                             (default=1)
# This value can be specified for all states at once, with the 'sprite_frame_count' property, and for
# each state individually, with a property of the form 'sprite_state<i>_frame_count', where 'i' is
# the state number. If ommited, a value of 1 is assumed (single frame). When specifying each state 
# frame count, you can ommit this value for states that have only 1 frame in them.
#
# Examples: "sprite_frame_count = 2"
#           or
#           "sprite_state0_frame_count = 2"
#           "sprite_state1_frame_count = 2"

# If both are specified, all states will be set with the former value and then overriden individually

# (Optional) The duration, in seconds, of each frame (can be an fractionary number).                     (default=0.25)
# If ommitted, a value of 0.25 (quarter of a second) is used by default, which should be OK for most
# cases. Smaller values gives faster animations. If zero or a negative value is specified, no frame
# cycling will occur at all (and thus, no animation). Because of that, a value of -1 is recommended
# for cases when there is a single frame only in each state. Specifying this value is optional and 
# if you are unsure, set as default or leave unspecified. 
sprite_frame_duration = default

# (Optional) The positions of the brakelights in relation to the vehicle's sprite.
# These coordinates are used to position the brakelights effects on the screen when braking and 
# probably should be different for each sprite state. Fill these values by measuring the position
# of where should the brakelights appear on each sprite state. Pay attention on the number of
# positions as they should match the number of states. For each entry, a pair of integers is
# expected. Alternatively, you may specify the X and Y position in two separate entries.
#
# Example: "brakelights_position0 = 10, 25"
#          or 
#          "brakelights_position0_x = 10"
#          "brakelights_position0_y = 25"
#
# If nothing is specified, a default position will be generated, but it's almost surely won't
# match appropriately. If the 'brakelights_multiple_sprites' property is true, the default
# positions will all be set zero.

# The image must contain either a single image or a sheet with a number of sprites matching the
# amount of states (each case should be reported in the 'brakelights_multiple_sprites' property).
# Note that the actual brakelight image portraited in the sheet should be in the same scale as
# the vehicle sprite sheet if the 'brakelights_multiple_sprites' property is set as true.
# If set as default, a built-in asset will be used for the effect. If left unspecified, no
# brakelights will be drawn at all.

# will be used for all animation states. If true, the brakelight animation is assumed instead
# to have multiple sprites (sheet) on the image file, one per each animation state. The 
# brakelight sheet is also assumed to contain N equally sized frames, where N is the number of 
# states of this animation.
brakelights_multiple_sprites = false

# (Optional) Specifies whether the brakelight sprite will be drawn mirrowed as well.              (default=true)

# opposite of the vehicle. The position of the mirrowed brakelights is a mirrowed version of the
# brakelights positions, minus the animation width.

# to be the same as the main vehicle sprite's scale. Otherwise it is assumed to be 1.0.
brakelights_sprite_scale = default

# (Optional) Specifies an offset applied to the brakelights sprites' positions, meant to          (default=<depends>)
# center them when necessary, i.e. mirrowed sprites with surrounding alpha regions.
# If a value is specified for the 'brakelights_sprite_filename' property, this value is
# defaulted to 0. If 'brakelights_sprite_filename' is left unspecified of defaulted, a builtin
# value is set to match the default brakelights sprite metrics.

# top-down position. Also, the shadow image should be in the same scale as the vehicle sprite.

# is no shadow to draw/cast. The sheet should include a number of sprites matching the
# amount of animation states.
shadow_sprite_filename = none

# (Optional) The positions of the shadows in relation to the vehicle's sprite.
# These coordinates are used to position the shadow sprites on the screen; they probably 
# should be different for each sprite state. Fill these values by measuring the position
# of where should the shadow appear behind on each sprite state. Pay attention on the number of
# positions as they should match the number of states. The synthax is the same as the 
# brakelights position, but replacing the 'brakelights' word with 'shadow'.
