### TRANSMISSION

# The number of gears. Any positive integer can be used.    (default=6)

# Gear ratios mode. Can be default or custom.

# If gear_ratios is set as "custom", then these items specify each ratio for each gear,

### SPRITE

# The image containing all the sprites (sprite sheet)      (default=built-in sprite)

# (Optional) The vehicle's width (in pixels) as depicted on the sprite.          (default=85.7% of frame width)
# Although optional, it is recommended to specify this to improve the alignment of effects, such as 
# the tires' burnout smoke. If defaulted or non-specified, it is set as 85.7% of the sprite's 
# frame width.
sprite_vehicle_width = 48

# (Optional) A scaling factor applied to the sprite; 1.0 is no scaling.        (default=1.0)
# Although optional, it is recommended to specify this, otherwise the vehicle can appear too big or 
# too small compared to the others. The recommended way to obtain a suitable value for scale is to 
# divide the vehicle's real life width (in mm) by its width on the sprite (in pixels) and 
# then multiply the result by 24/895.

# (Optional) The offset between the sprite's bottom and the depicted contact point of the vehicle.     (default=0)
# Usually the contact point(s) are the bottom of the vehicle's wheels, so this value can be fitted
# with ammount of pixels between the bottom of the sprite and bottom of the wheels. This is useful
# to specify when the sprite has a unusually large shadow, for example.
sprite_contact_offset = 2

# (Optional) The approximate angle (in degrees) depicted on the last sprite (most turned).        (default=60)
# The actual angle depicted on sprites varies a lot and even their most turned position may be small, 
# causing a weird "feeling" in-game that the car is understeering. So specifying a value less than 45
# causes the sprite to "develop" faster (turn faster), althought there is no change on the actual 
# physics of the game. Values greater than 45 makes some sprites not show on screen since the maximum
# angle in-game is supposed to be 45 degreeds (pi/4 radians). Specifying this value is optional and 
# if you are unsure, set as default or leave unspecified. 
sprite_max_depicted_turn_angle = 16

# (Optional) The duration (seconds) of each frame. Can be an fractionary number, i.e. 0.25 (sec).    (default=-1; no cycle)
# This value can (and should) be ommitted or set as -1 when there is only 1 frame in each state.

# (Optional) The number of frames on each state.    (default=1)
# You can ommit specifying this for the states that have only 1 frame in them.
# You can also specify a single value for all states at once using the property 'sprite_frame_count'.
# If 'sprite_frame_count' is specified, all states will be set with this value, but will be overriden
# individually by each 'sprite_state<i>_frame_count' property.
sprite_frame_count = 1

# (Optional) The positions of the brakelights in relation to the vehicle's sprite.
# These coordinates are used to position the brakelights effects on the screen when braking and 
# probably should be different for each sprite state. Fill these values by measuring the position
# of where should the brakelights appear on each sprite state. Pay attention on the number of
# positions as they should match the number of states. For each entry, a pair of integers is
# expected. Alternatively, you may specify the X and Y position in two separate entries.
#
# Example: "brakelights_position0 = 10, 25"
#          or 
#          "brakelights_position0_x = 10"
#          "brakelights_position0_y = 25"
#
# If nothing is specified, a default position will be generated, but it's almost surely won't
# match appropriately. If the 'brakelights_multiple_sprites' property is true, the default
# positions will all be set zero.

# The image must contain either a single image or a sheet with a number of sprites matching the
# amount of states (each case should be reported in the 'brakelights_multiple_sprites' property).
# Note that the actual brakelight image portraited in the sheet should be in the same scale as
# the vehicle sprite sheet if the 'brakelights_multiple_sprites' property is set as true.
# If unspecified or set as default, a built-in asset will be used for the effect.

# (Optional) Specifies whether the brakelight sprite is a single image or a sprite sheet.         (default=false)
# If false, it's assumed that there only a single brakelight sprite on the image file, and it 
# will be used for all animation states. If true, the brakelight animation is assumed instead
# to have multiple sprites (sheet) on the image file, one per each animation state. The 
# brakelight sheet is also assumed to contain N equally sized frames, where N is the number of 
# states of this animation.
brakelights_multiple_sprites = false

# (Optional) Specifies whether the brakelight sprite will be drawn mirrowed as well.              (default=true)
# If true (default), a mirrowed version of the brakeligthts animation is also drawn in the 
# opposite of the vehicle. The position of the mirrowed brakelights is a mirrowed version of the
# brakelights positions, minus the animation width.

# (Optional) Specifies scaling factor applied to the brakelight sprite; 1.0 is no scaling.        (default=<depends>)
# If a non-default 'brakelights_sprite_filename' property is specified, this scale is assumed
# to be the same as the main vehicle sprite's scale. Otherwise it is assumed to be 1.0.
brakelights_sprite_scale = default

# (Optional) Specifies an offset applied to the brakelights sprites' positions, meant to          (default=<depends>)
# center them when necessary, i.e. mirrowed sprites with surrounding alpha regions.
# If a value is specified for the 'brakelights_sprite_filename' property, this value is
# defaulted to 0. If 'brakelights_sprite_filename' is left unspecified of defaulted, a builtin
# value is set to match the default brakelights sprite metrics.
brakelights_sprite_offset_x = default
brakelights_sprite_offset_y = default

# (Optional) The filename of the image containing the sprite for the optional shadow overlay.      (default=none)
# If this field is specified, the shadow sprite will be drawn before the vehicle sprite.
# Note that this sprites should depict the vehicle's shadow as it was being cast from
# top-down position. Also, the shadow image should be in the same scale as the vehicle sprite.
# If this field is assigned 'none', 'default' or is left unspecified, it's assumed that there
# is no shadow to draw/cast. The sheet should include a number of sprites matching the
# amount of animation states.
shadow_sprite_filename = shadow.png

# (Optional) The positions of the shadows in relation to the vehicle's sprite.
# These coordinates are used to position the shadow sprites on the screen; they probably 
# should be different for each sprite state. Fill these values by measuring the position
# of where should the shadow appear behind on each sprite state. Pay attention on the number of
# positions as they should match the number of states. The synthax is the same as the 
# brakelights position, but replacing the 'brakelights' word with 'shadow'. 
# If nothing is specified, default positions will be generated with coordinates (0, 0).
