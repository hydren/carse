Advices when building with eclipse:

- When carse is build using fgeal, it will need libfgeal.so to run. To be able to run ad hoc, you need to edit the run configuration:
 * Open the run configuration for editing
 * Go to the "Environment" tab
 * Add a entry named LD_LIBRARY_PATH, with value "${workspace_loc:/fgeal/libs}" (without quotes)
 
 Alternatively, you can create a symbolic link (or copy manually every time) the libfgeal.so (or .a) file to project root folder (remember to not commit the file in git)
 
- Remember to run a script to copy .so/.a files from fgeal project to its /libs folder (create folder if absent) every time when switching backend engine on fgeal project.
